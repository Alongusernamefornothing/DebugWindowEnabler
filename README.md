# DebugWindowRewritten
Did you know that a Debug Window exists in Sebs SW CV. Use can start it by using a dll.
## Supported versions
DebugWindowRewritten does works with Sebs SW CV 3.5.* and newer
## Unsupported versions
Versions 3.1 - 3.3 use this [Version](https://github.com/stopyouhelper24/DebugWindowEnabler/releases/tag/1.0.0.0). 3.0 and older does not have a Debug Window.
## Debug Window does not exist on 3.5
Insiders of Sebs SW CV have said to me that the Form that is needed does not exist on builds newer then 3.5.0.456.
## Trying to fix it on 3.5
Found out that the form does still exist. but under the name "ProgramTester"
