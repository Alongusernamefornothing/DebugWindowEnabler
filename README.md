# DebugWindowEnabler
Can a Debug Window in Sebs SW CV using one DLL.
## Supported versions
 Sebs SW CV 3.1.* - 3.3.*
## Unsupported versions
Versions 3.0 and older does not have a Debug Window.
## Debug Window does not exist on 3.5
Insiders of Sebs SW CV have said to me that the Form that is needed does not exist on builds newer then 3.5.0.456.
## How to use
This part of the readme file is not done.
## Trying to fix it on 3.5
I'll try to mod the existing dll file to readd it. I'll do my own rewrite of the code soon.
